// The Game of Life allows the user to simulate the life cycle of bacteria (following a specific set of rules) by first inputting a
// text file name containing a bacterial colony grid. The main function first sets up the console by displaying the rules, creating
// the initial grid, and then animating the life cycle frame by frame. The user is given various options such as choosing the initial
// grid, if they want to wrap, and how they want to animate the simulation.
