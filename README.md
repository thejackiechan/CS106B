# CS106B

By Jackie Chan with help from David Morales and Tessera Chin

#Life:
The Game of Life allows the user to simulate the life cycle of bacteria (following a specific set of rules) by first inputting a text file name containing a bacterial colony grid. The main function first sets up the console by displaying the rules, creating the initial grid, and then animating the life cycle frame by frame. The user is given various options such as choosing the initial grid, if they want to wrap, and how they want to animate the simulation.

#Recursion:
Recursion is used to generate various fractals such as Sierpinski triangles, Mandelbrot sets, and trees. The GrammarSolver folder contains grammar generating code for CS106B. It takes in user input regarding the text file, symbol, and number of times to generate it. (Partner: Ike Osafo)

#Serafini: 
In Ngrams/Random Writer, the user inputs a file name, the number of word blocks (called N-grams), and the amount of words they wish to generate. The main function sets this up by first displaying the instructions, and then proceeding to read through the file while building up a map of N-grams. Once the entire map is populated, it is used to generate random text based on the input file which surprisingly sounds the same as the original text! Word Ladder takes in two words and transforms one into the other by changing only one letter at a time. Furthermore, it does this in the most efficient/shortest path possible.
